University coursework. Grade: 92%

# IceHockey

This is my year 1 programming coursework.

This is a demonstrative piece of all the skills and techniques I've learnt during my first year of Software Engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University.

There are still bugs to fix and features I could add, but this is identical to how it was submitted for grading.

Includes:
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Enumerated sets
- Switchcases
- Encapsulation
- Etc...
